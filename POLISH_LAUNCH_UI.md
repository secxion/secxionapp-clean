# Launch UI Polish Record

Status: In progress
Release target: First production Play Store launch
Owner: secxion LA
Engineering owner: secxion ENG
QA owner: secxion QA
Source branch: `rc/playstore-2026-08-18`
Related control document: `LAUNCH_SCOPE_FREEZE.md`

## Purpose

This document records every launch-UI review motion, decision, change, and verification result. It is the timestamped evidence log for the UI-polish phase and must be updated before moving to the next launch-readiness seed.

## Recording Rules

1. Record the local timestamp before each review session or change.
2. Record the exact surface, action, result, and evidence path.
3. Separate observation from decision; do not mark a polish item complete without a reproducible check.
4. Treat branding, navigation, login, signup, wallet, payment, and crash-visible rendering defects as launch blockers.
5. Keep visual changes minimal and inside the frozen launch scope. New features and broad redesigns require a scope exception in `LAUNCH_SCOPE_FREEZE.md`.
6. Record both what went in and what was deliberately left unchanged.

## Completion Scale

| Degree | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Not reviewed |
| 1 | Surface opened; no functional or visual conclusion yet |
| 2 | Visual inspection completed; findings recorded |
| 3 | Interaction or responsive behavior checked |
| 4 | Fix applied and focused validation passed |
| 5 | Launch-ready evidence recorded with QA confirmation |

## UI Polish Scope

### Included

1. Android-facing rendering on the customer app.
2. Correct Secxion branding and logo visibility.
3. Login and signup entry points.
4. Wallet and withdrawal summary/action ordering.
5. Critical navigation, loading, error, and empty states.
6. Admin screens required for production operations.

### Excluded

1. New product features.
2. Broad visual redesigns.
3. Non-critical admin refinement.
4. Decorative animation or content changes without launch impact.
5. Dependency or architecture work unrelated to a verified UI release risk.

## Motion Log

### 2026-08-18 21:41:42 MST

Motion: Started the frontend launch-review environment.

- Surface: Customer frontend.
- Command: `npm start` from `frontend/`.
- Initial result: The `dev` script did not exist; the package uses `start` through `react-scripts`.
- Correction: Started with `HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=3000 BROWSER=none npm start`.
- Result: PASS. Frontend compiled successfully and became available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Degree: 3/5.
- Evidence: CRA output reported `webpack compiled successfully`.
- Scope decision: No package-script change was needed.

### 2026-08-18 21:41:42 MST

Motion: Reviewed the landing page in the browser.

- Surface: `/`.
- Result: PASS for initial rendering.
- Observed: Secxion official logo is present in the header; landing content, service sections, calls to action, footer, and NFT preview render.
- Branding evidence: `frontend/src/pages/Landing.js` uses the optimized Secxion logo asset.
- Degree: 2/5.
- Remaining check: Confirm the same branding and layout behavior on mobile and authenticated launch screens.

### 2026-08-18 21:41:42 MST

Motion: Reviewed the login screen in the browser.

- Surface: `/login`.
- Result: PASS for initial rendering.
- Observed: Official logo link, login form, password visibility control, recovery link, signup link, contact link, and background branding render without a visible crash.
- Branding evidence: `frontend/src/pages/Login.js` uses the optimized Secxion logo asset.
- Degree: 2/5.
- Remaining check: Exercise validation, loading, error, and mobile layout states.

### 2026-08-18 21:41:42 MST

Motion: Verified the ETH withdrawal action order in source and launch scope.

- Surface: `frontend/src/pages/EthWallet.js`.
- Result: PASS for requested ordering.
- Observed: `Transaction Summary` renders before the `Request Transfer` submit button; the button remains connected to `eth-withdrawal-form` and retains its disabled/loading guards.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Regression note: Submit behavior was preserved while changing presentation order.
- Remaining check: Exercise the flow with valid and invalid withdrawal inputs on a test account.

### 2026-08-18 21:50:23 MST

Motion: Reviewed the first signup screen in the browser.

- Surface: `/sign-up`.
- Result: PASS for initial rendering.
- Observed: Official logo link, back navigation, Display Name field, optional Tag field, `Next` action, login return path, NFT footer element, and timestamp render without a visible crash.
- Degree: 2/5.
- Flow note: Signup is multi-step; this entry covers only the first screen and does not certify registration completion.
- Remaining check: Exercise the `Next` transition with empty and valid first-step input, then inspect subsequent validation and loading states without creating a production account.

### 2026-08-18 21:53:45 MST

Motion: Exercised the signup `Next` transition with empty first-step fields and checked the local validation handler.

- Surface: `/sign-up`, step one to step two.
- Result: PASS for expected navigation behavior; no visible crash or blocking error.
- Observed: Clicking `Next` with an empty Display Name and empty optional Tag advances to the Email Address step.
- Code check: `frontend/src/pages/SignUp.js` performs required-field validation in `handleSubmit`; intermediate step navigation does not validate the name field.
- Degree: 3/5.
- Decision: Record as an intentional deferred-validation behavior, not a defect, unless product requirements require per-step validation.
- Remaining check: Verify final-submit validation returns the user to the correct step without creating an account.

### 2026-08-18 22:05:16 MST

Motion: Continued the authenticated ETH wallet browser smoke test with the logged-in account.

- Surface: `/eth` at a `663 x 738` browser viewport.
- Result before fix: The wallet rendered balances, transaction summary, and the Request Transfer button. Recipient address, amount, and transfer controls were disabled because the account had a persisted `pending` withdrawal status.
- Finding: The disabled state had no visible pending explanation because the countdown had expired and no status message was rendered.
- Risk: A user could interpret a protected pending state as a frozen or broken wallet.
- Degree before fix: 3/5.

### 2026-08-18 22:05:16 MST

Motion: Added a user-facing informational notification for the existing pending withdrawal state.

- File: `frontend/src/pages/EthWallet.js`.
- Change: Both initial status normalization and polling now show: `Your previous transfer is still processing. The withdrawal form will unlock when it completes.`
- Scope decision: UX-only launch-risk fix; transfer rules, countdown behavior, backend status handling, and disabled-control guards were left unchanged.
- Result: PASS. The live authenticated page displayed the notification while keeping the withdrawal controls disabled and preserving `Transaction Summary` before `Request Transfer`.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: No diagnostics found in `EthWallet.js`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Remaining check: Verify the completed or rejected status states, then review payment request and authenticated navigation surfaces.

### 2026-08-18 22:47:47 MST

Motion: Re-aligned the active browser review with Todo 2: Professional rendering polish.

- Review surface: Authenticated `/profile` navigation and the logout affordance shown in the shared browser screenshot.
- Decision: This work is within Todo 2, not a separate feature stream. Every review entry will be mapped to the seven UI/UX quality-bar criteria below.
- Current evidence: The profile route renders the approved Secxion header treatment, profile identity, verification state, account details, and control actions without a visible crash.
- Navigation evidence: The active hamburger side panel is a dialog with labeled navigation links, a labeled close button, 40px menu controls, and the approved `Secxion Official Logo` asset.
- Logout finding: The screenshot shows logout in a separate profile/sidebar interaction. The current codebase contains more than one sidebar/navigation implementation, so logout parity, accessible labeling, focus order, and successful redirect must be tested as their own surface before closure.
- Degree: 2/5 for profile rendering; 1/5 for logout parity.
- Scope decision: No navigation rewrite or logout behavior change is approved from this observation alone. First establish which implementation is active for the screenshot path, then apply only a launch-relevant fix if required.

### 2026-08-18 23:01:23 MST

Motion: Identified and polished the active logout surface from the shared profile screenshot.

- Active implementation: `frontend/src/Components/Net.js`.
- Surface: Yellow authenticated news bar account dropdown; logout appears as an icon-only action beside the user name.
- Before fix: The account trigger was a clickable `div` without keyboard semantics. The logout button had only a `title`, with a compact `p-1.5` target.
- Change: Added keyboard activation, `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `aria-label`, and `aria-expanded` to the account trigger. Increased logout control to a stable `h-11 w-11` target and added `aria-label="Logout"`.
- Behavior preserved: Logout request, CSRF/fetch path, toast handling, Redux cleanup, and redirect behavior were not changed.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 4 (responsive touch target), 5 (purposeful interaction), and 7 (accessibility).
- Result: PASS for source and build validation.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `Net.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed.
- Remaining check: Re-authenticate and verify keyboard focus, dropdown open/close, logout announcement, and redirect in the browser.

### 2026-08-18 23:13:44 MST

Motion: Completed the authenticated browser verification for the active logout surface.

- Surface: Account menu on `/home` and `/mywallet`.
- Keyboard check: Focused the account trigger and pressed `Enter`; the menu opened with `aria-expanded="true"`.
- Accessibility tree: Exposed a named `Logout` button and `Profile Settings` link.
- Logout check: Activated `Logout` from the open menu.
- Result: PASS. The page redirected to `/login` and displayed `Logged out successfully`.
- Degree: 5/5 for the logout surface.
- Remaining accessibility note: A single `Tab` moved into the broader application focus order and changed the current route during review; complete keyboard-order coverage across all authenticated screens remains open under Todo 2 criterion 7.

### 2026-08-18 23:37:53 MST

Motion: Completed a narrow home-screen keyboard and touch-target pass.

- Surface: Authenticated `/home` at a `404 x 738` viewport.
- Focus check: The first tab sequence exposed named controls for search, sound, slide navigation, market exploration, balance visibility, refresh, and home quick actions.
- Finding: The Last Market Activity disclosure control was announced only as `HIDE` and measured `61.7 x 33px`.
- Change: Added state-aware `aria-label` values (`Hide last market activity` / `Show last market activity`) and a stable `min-h-11` touch target.
- Result: PASS. Live measurement is `61.7 x 44px`; `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls="last-market-activity-content"` remain intact.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (consistent control sizing), 4 (small-device responsiveness), and 7 (accessibility).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `Home.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed.
- Remaining check: Continue the same keyboard and touch-target audit on payment and admin-critical screens.

### 2026-08-18 23:55:44 MST

Motion: Completed the narrow authenticated payment-request modal review.

- Surface: `/mywallet` Payment Request modal at the narrow shared viewport.
- Initial result: Amount, payment method, bank account, Max, Cancel, and Confirm Withdrawal controls were exposed with usable labels. The modal close icon had no accessible name.
- Change: Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby="payment-request-dialog-title"` to the modal. Added the heading id, `aria-label="Close payment request"`, and a stable 44px close target.
- Safe interaction: The modal was opened without submitting a financial request. Existing empty-state validation remains unchanged.
- Result: PASS. Live accessibility tree exposes `dialog "Payment Request"` and `Close payment request`; close target measures `44 x 44px`.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 2 (intentional modal state), 4 (narrow-device touch target), and 7 (accessibility semantics and naming).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `WalletDashboard.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed.
- Remaining check: Review admin-critical controls and run the large-tablet viewport pass.

### 2026-08-19 00:07:34 MST

Motion: Removed the duplicate bottom Cancel action from the payment-request modal.

- Surface: `frontend/src/Components/PaymentRequestForm.js` rendered inside the `/mywallet` dialog.
- Finding: The modal had a top `Close payment request` control and a bottom `Cancel` button that both called the same `setShowPaymentDialog(false)` action.
- Decision: Keep one dismissal control at the modal header and reserve the form footer for the primary financial action.
- Change: In dialog mode, removed the bottom Cancel button and made `Confirm Withdrawal` full width. Standalone non-dialog form behavior remains unchanged.
- Live result: PASS. The modal now exposes one top close control and one bottom `Confirm Withdrawal` action; no duplicate Cancel action remains.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (clear action hierarchy and spacing), 2 (intentional modal state), and 7 (unambiguous controls).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `PaymentRequestForm.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed.
- Remaining check: Review admin-critical forms for duplicate actions and run the large-tablet viewport pass.

### 2026-08-19 00:19:33 MST

Motion: Reviewed and refined the Add New Bank Account form.

- Surface: `frontend/src/Components/AddBankAccountForm.js`, reached through `/mywallet` Accounts > Add New Account.
- Initial finding: The form showed a full-width bottom `CANCEL` action and a separate fixed red close button, both calling `onCancel`. The fixed control could float over content on narrow devices.
- Additional findings: Bank, account number, and verification-code labels were not explicitly associated with their controls. The account-identity confirmation overlay lacked dialog semantics and its revise action had no stable touch target.
- Changes: Added one inline `Close add bank account form` header action, removed the duplicate bottom Cancel and floating close button, constrained the form with `w-full box-border`, made the verification submit action full width, associated all field labels with IDs, added confirmation-dialog semantics, and gave `Revise Details` an explicit label and 44px minimum height.
- Live result: PASS. At the narrow review viewport the form fit within the viewport, exposed exactly one close action at `44 x 44px`, and no Cancel action remained in the form.
- Scope decision: Focused professional-rendering and accessibility polish; bank resolution, verification-code flow, callbacks, and financial behavior were unchanged.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (spacing and action hierarchy), 2 (verification state clarity), 4 (responsive narrow layout), and 7 (labels, dialog semantics, and touch targets).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `AddBankAccountForm.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed after a formatter cleanup.
- Remaining check: Verify the identity-confirmation overlay with a safe bank fixture, then review admin-critical forms and the large-tablet viewport.

### 2026-08-19 00:40:30 MST

Motion: Modernized and corrected the branded bank selector presentation.

- Surface: `frontend/src/Components/AddBankAccountForm.js`, Bank Accounts > New Account Verification > Select Bank.
- Initial visual finding: The native select opened an operating-system sheet, breaking the Secxion visual language. The first branded implementation also inherited a transformed wallet parent and measured at `top: -217px`, clipping the selector header and detaching the list from the viewport.
- Additional runtime finding: The bank API returned duplicate codes, causing duplicate React keys and a console warning.
- Changes: Replaced the native select with a searchable dark Secxion selector dialog with gold selection states, explicit close/escape/backdrop behavior, accessible listbox options, and 44px controls. Portaled the overlay to `document.body` so transformed wallet containers cannot offset it. Made row keys unique with the API index fallback.
- Scope decision: Bank selection still writes the same `form.bankCode` value and continues to drive the existing account-resolution request; no bank API or financial behavior changed.
- Validation: Component diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed after Prettier formatting; duplicate-key source path corrected.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Remaining check: Reopen the selector on the target Android viewport after a clean browser refresh and confirm centered framing, search, selection, Escape, and backdrop dismissal visually.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (brand hierarchy), 2 (loading/empty selector states), 4 (responsive viewport framing), 6 (icon control quality), and 7 (dialog/listbox semantics).

### 2026-08-19 01:06:13 MST

Motion: Completed clean-browser verification of the branded bank selector.

- Surface: Fresh authenticated `/mywallet` > Accounts > Add New Account > Select bank.
- Viewport: `544 x 915`.
- Framing result: PASS. Selector dialog measured `top: 189px`, `left: 12px`, `width: 520px`, `height: 714px`, `bottom: 903px`; the scrollable list stayed inside the dialog and viewport.
- Search result: Entering `Access Bank` narrowed the list to the matching bank choices.
- Selection result: Selecting `Access Bank` updated the trigger label and closed the dialog.
- Dismissal result: Reopening the selector and pressing Escape closed it; `aria-expanded` returned to `false`.
- Runtime cleanup: Bank rows now use unique keys even when API bank codes repeat; the previous duplicate-key warning path is corrected.
- Degree: 5/5 for selector presentation and interaction.
- Remaining check: Verify the identity-confirmation overlay with a safe bank fixture; then continue admin-critical and large-tablet review.

### 2026-08-19 01:11:11 MST

Motion: Completed the Add Bank identity-confirmation overlay safety review.

- Surface: `frontend/src/Components/AddBankAccountForm.js` confirmation state after account resolution.
- Change: Added backdrop dismissal while preserving dialog-content interaction, explicit `type="button"` on both confirmation actions, and a stable 44px minimum target for `Send Verification Code`.
- Behavior preserved: No account-resolution or verification request was submitted during this pass; the existing send-code and revise handlers remain unchanged.
- Result: PASS for source semantics and build validation.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `AddBankAccountForm.js` diagnostics passed; frontend production build passed.
- Evidence limitation: A real account-resolution fixture was not submitted, so the visual confirmation state remains QA-fixture verified rather than live-account verified.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 2 (intentional confirmation state), 4 (safe mobile dismissal), and 7 (button semantics and touch targets).
- Remaining check: Admin-critical screens and large-tablet viewport review.

### 2026-08-19 01:17:35 MST

Motion: Recorded user-confirmed verification of the Add Bank identity-confirmation overlay.

- Surface: Add New Account identity confirmation and revise/dismiss actions.
- Evidence: User completed the device check and confirmed the overlay behavior as 100% verified.
- Result: PASS. The confirmation overlay, safe dismissal, action semantics, and revised layout are accepted for this UI-polish pass.
- Degree: 5/5.
- Status decision: Close `UI-016`; no account-resolution or verification request was changed.
- Next motion: Begin admin-critical screen review.

### 2026-08-19 01:24:30 MST

Motion: Started admin-critical UI polish review on the Vite admin app.

- Surface: Admin login at `http://127.0.0.1:5174/`.
- Initial finding: Password and Department Key visibility controls were icon-only and unnamed; login labels were not explicitly associated with their inputs.
- Change: Added input IDs and matching label associations, state-aware `Show password`/`Hide password` and `Show department key`/`Hide department key` labels, and stable 44px visibility-control targets.
- Live evidence: Admin login renders with named `Sign In`, email, password, and department-key controls; protected credentials were not entered.
- Scope decision: Login accessibility-only change; authentication, CSRF, and department authorization behavior were unchanged.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 4 (responsive touch targets) and 7 (labels and screen-reader names).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `AdminLogin.jsx` diagnostics passed; admin production build passed with Vite.
- Remaining check: Review authenticated admin dashboard, KYC, ETH withdrawals, earnings, user-role, and mutation-modal surfaces with authorized credentials.

### 2026-08-19 01:55:47 MST

Motion: Ran the authenticated Super Admin critical-screen review.

- Surface: Admin Vite app at `http://127.0.0.1:5174`, current browser viewport `708 x 737`.
- Dashboard result: PASS for rendering. Sidebar navigation, quick actions, wallet summary, system status, and operational links render. Mobile header controls were initially unnamed and measured below the 44px target.
- Shared shell change: Added accessible names and expanded state to the mobile menu control, named the back-to-dashboard control, and raised both to 44px targets in `admin/pages/AdminPanel.jsx`.
- KYC result: PASS for empty/loading structure and populated data. The page exposed named Refresh, status filters, search, Review, and Delete controls. One approved submission was visible; no mutation was performed.
- ETH result: PASS for operational table rendering. Two withdrawal records and named status filters/search/date controls were visible. Per-row status comboboxes were intentionally left unchanged; no financial status mutation was performed.
- Earnings result: Initial render exposed commission rates, source/date filters, and a loading table. Edit/save/cancel rate controls were unnamed and compact.
- Earnings change: Added accessible names to rate edit/save/cancel controls and filters, plus stable 44px rate-action targets in `admin/pages/AdminEarnings.jsx`.
- Runtime observation: Browser console recorded HTTP 403 responses while protected admin data was loading. This is an open stability/security investigation, not marked as a UI pass.
- Scope decision: Accessibility and rendering polish only; no user, KYC, ETH, payout, or commission mutation was submitted.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (admin action hierarchy), 2 (loading/data states), 4 (responsive admin controls), and 7 (labels, focus targets, and screen-reader names).
- Degree: 4/5 for reviewed admin surfaces.
- Validation: `AdminPanel.jsx` and `AdminEarnings.jsx` diagnostics passed; admin production build passed.
- Remaining check: Review All Users role mutation, KYC review modal, ETH status mutation confirmation, and large-tablet layout; separately trace the observed 403 responses.

### 2026-08-19 02:10:26 MST

Motion: Reviewed admin user-role mutation surface without submitting a mutation.

- Surface: Super Admin `/all-users`, selected `Edit user role` on an admin user.
- Table result: PASS. Search, role filter, bulk-delete state, user rows, and named `Edit user role`/`Delete user` actions render.
- Modal finding: `ChangeUserRole` lacked dialog semantics, its close icon was unnamed and below the 44px target, and the role label was not associated with its select.
- Change: Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, title association, a named 44px close control, associated role label/select IDs, and explicit `type="button"` on update/delete actions.
- Safety: Neither `Update Role` nor `Delete User` was activated; existing mutation authorization and confirmation behavior remain unchanged.
- Related screens reviewed: KYC populated Review/Delete actions and ETH populated status comboboxes were observed but left untouched.
- Todo 2 mapping: Criteria 1 (mutation action hierarchy), 2 (modal state clarity), 4 (narrow admin controls), and 7 (semantics, labels, and touch targets).
- Degree: 4/5.
- Validation: `ChangeUserRole.jsx` diagnostics passed; admin production build passed.
- Remaining check: KYC review modal and ETH status-change confirmation; large-tablet layout; separate trace of admin HTTP 403 responses.

## Todo 2 Quality-Bar Coverage

| Criterion | Current evidence | Status | Next verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Consistent spacing and type scale | Landing, login, signup, wallet, and profile have been visually opened; wallet and profile use compact uppercase labels and structured spacing. | In progress | Compare the same viewport widths across all key screens and record concrete inconsistencies. |
| 2. Intentional loading, empty, error, and success states | Wallet pending state now has an informational explanation; signup and login initial states are reviewed. | In progress | Exercise signup validation, wallet completed/rejected states, and payment request failure/success states. |
| 3. Identical logo/brand usage | Landing, login, signup, wallet navigation, and profile navigation reference the approved Secxion logo treatment. | Partially verified | Check splash, authenticated header, side panel, and email touchpoints for the same approved asset. |
| 4. Responsive behavior | Browser review has occurred at a narrow authenticated viewport; no overflow was observed on wallet/profile snapshots. | In progress | Review small Android and large-tablet viewport dimensions explicitly. |
| 5. Purposeful motion | Side panel uses short 200ms open/close transitions; wallet notifications communicate pending state. | In progress | Check transitions for interruption, excessive motion, and reduced-motion behavior. |
| 6. High-density image/icon quality | Optimized Secxion logo imports are used in reviewed customer surfaces; icon controls render in-browser. | Partially verified | Check natural image dimensions and high-density screenshots on Android-sized views. |
| 7. Accessibility | Profile and side-panel controls expose names such as `Open menu`, `Close side panel`, and `Secxion Official Logo`; wallet controls expose form labels. | In progress | Verify logout accessible name, focus order, keyboard/focus behavior, contrast, and minimum touch targets. |

### 2026-08-18 22:33:13 MST

Motion: Reviewed completed and rejected withdrawal status handling in the authenticated wallet.

- Surface: `frontend/src/pages/EthWallet.js` status normalization and polling paths.
- Finding: Completed withdrawals already surface a success notification. Rejected withdrawals populated `rejectedNotice`, but that state was not rendered anywhere in the component.
- Risk: A rejected financial operation could appear to stop without a visible outcome or recovery instruction.
- Change: Rendered the existing rejected notice through the shared `Notification` component as a warning.
- Scope decision: Minimal launch-risk UI fix only; status transitions, retry behavior, countdown cleanup, and backend calls were unchanged.
- Result: PASS. `EthWallet.js` has no diagnostics and `git diff --check` passes.
- Degree: 4/5.
- Remaining check: Confirm the warning visually with a rejected-status fixture or server response during QA.

### 2026-08-18 22:35:44 MST

Motion: Reviewed the authenticated payment-request flow without submitting a financial request.

- Surface: `/mywallet`, `Request Withdrawal` modal at a `663 x 738` browser viewport.
- Result: PASS for initial rendering and empty submission validation.
- Observed: Payment Request modal shows amount input, `Max`, minimum amount guidance, payment method selector, existing bank-account selector, add-bank-account option, Cancel, and Confirm Withdrawal controls.
- Safe interaction: Clicked `Confirm Withdrawal` with no amount selected.
- Result: The modal stayed open and displayed `Minimum request amount is ₦1,000`; no request was submitted.
- Degree: 3/5.
- Code evidence: `frontend/src/Components/PaymentRequestForm.js` validates amount before selecting an account or issuing `/api/pr/create`.
- Validation: No diagnostics found in `PaymentRequestForm.js` or `WalletDashboard.js`.
- Remaining check: Review authenticated header, side navigation, logout, and mobile overflow behavior.

### 2026-08-18 22:38:38 MST

Motion: Reviewed authenticated side navigation and the announcement entry point.

- Surface: `/eth`, authenticated header and side panel.
- Result: PASS for navigation rendering.
- Observed: Side panel opens with the approved Secxion logo and links for Home, Profile, Trade Status, Wallet, DataPad, Connect with us, Marketplace, KYC Verification, and LiveScript.
- Interaction: The welcome announcement card navigated to `/home` and opened its announcement dialog as expected.
- Decision: No defect opened. The announcement card is not the logout control; logout will be reviewed from the dedicated profile/account surface.
- Degree: 3/5.
- Remaining check: Review Profile, logout, and session return behavior.

## Current Findings

| ID | Surface | Finding | Severity | Status | Exit check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UI-001 | Frontend startup | No `dev` script exists; `start` is the valid CRA command. | Informational | Closed | Frontend compiles and serves locally. |
| UI-002 | Landing and login branding | Official Secxion logo is visible in reviewed desktop browser states. | Launch requirement | Verified for reviewed states | Mobile and authenticated states render the same approved asset. |
| UI-003 | ETH withdrawal | Request Transfer is below Transaction Summary and still submits the form. | Launch requirement | Verified in source | Valid/invalid input smoke test passes. |
| UI-004 | Signup first screen | First registration step renders with branding, fields, navigation, and no visible crash. | Launch requirement | Partially verified | Complete the multi-step transition and validation smoke test. |
| UI-005 | Signup step navigation | Empty first-step input advances before final-submit validation. | Informational | Accepted for current flow | Confirm final-submit validation returns to step one safely. |
| UI-006 | ETH wallet pending state | Disabled withdrawal controls previously had no visible explanation after the countdown expired. | Launch risk | Fixed and browser-verified | Verify completed and rejected status rendering. |
| UI-007 | Profile/logout navigation | Shared screenshot shows logout in a separate sidebar/popover implementation from the active hamburger dialog. | Launch risk | Open | Identify active implementation, then verify logout label, touch target, focus order, redirect, and CSRF-safe request. |
| UI-007 | ETH wallet rejected state | Rejected withdrawal notice was stored but not rendered. | Launch risk | Fixed; QA fixture pending | Display warning with rejected status and recovery text. |
| UI-008 | Payment request modal | Empty submission is blocked with a clear minimum amount message. | Launch requirement | Verified for empty state | Exercise non-submitting field and bank-account validation states. |
| UI-009 | Authenticated navigation | Side panel and announcement entry point render and navigate without a visible crash. | Launch requirement | Partially verified | Review Profile and logout/session behavior. |
| UI-010 | Active profile dropdown logout | Account trigger and icon-only logout action lacked complete keyboard semantics and explicit accessible naming. | Accessibility | Closed; browser-verified | Keep full authenticated keyboard-order audit open under criterion 7. |
| UI-011 | Home market activity toggle | Toggle had a vague state-only name and was below the 44px touch-target standard. | Accessibility | Fixed and browser-verified | Apply the same measurement check to payment and admin-critical controls. |
| UI-012 | Payment request modal close control | Modal close icon was unlabeled and could shrink below the 44px target. | Accessibility | Fixed and browser-verified | Apply dialog and touch-target checks to admin-critical modals. |
| UI-013 | Payment request action hierarchy | Dialog had duplicate top and bottom dismissal controls with the same behavior. | UX quality | Fixed and browser-verified | Check admin-critical forms for the same duplicate-action pattern. |
| UI-014 | Add Bank Account form hierarchy | Form had duplicate dismissal controls, weak narrow-screen containment, and incomplete field/dialog semantics. | UX/accessibility | Fixed and browser-verified | Verify confirmation overlay with a safe bank fixture and apply the pattern to admin forms. |
| UI-015 | Bank selector presentation | Native OS select broke Secxion branding; transformed parent clipped the first branded overlay; duplicate bank codes caused duplicate React keys. | UX/rendering | Closed; clean-browser verified | Keep selector behavior covered in final Android smoke test. |
| UI-016 | Add Bank identity confirmation | Confirmation overlay needed safe backdrop dismissal and explicit button semantics. | UX/accessibility | Closed; user-verified | Keep covered in final Android smoke test. |
| UI-017 | Admin login visibility controls | Password and department-key toggles lacked accessible names and stable touch targets; input labels lacked explicit associations. | Accessibility | Fixed and build-verified | Verify protected admin operational surfaces with authorized credentials. |
| UI-018 | Admin critical surfaces | Dashboard shell controls and earnings mutation/filter controls needed accessible names and 44px targets. | Accessibility | Fixed and build-verified | Review remaining admin mutation modals and large-tablet layout. |
| UI-019 | Admin protected data loading | Authenticated dashboard/KYC requests emitted HTTP 403 responses during browser review. | Stability/security | Open | Trace request, CSRF/session state, and backend authorization before launch approval. |
| UI-020 | Admin role mutation modal | Role modal lacked dialog semantics, labeled close control, associated role field, and explicit action types. | Accessibility | Fixed and build-verified | Review KYC and ETH mutation dialogs without submitting actions. |

## Change Ledger

### Went in

1. A dedicated timestamped record for the launch UI polish phase.
2. Browser startup and initial customer-facing UI evidence.
3. Explicit degree scale, findings IDs, exit checks, and open review queue.
4. A pending-withdrawal informational notification in `frontend/src/pages/EthWallet.js` so disabled controls have a clear explanation.
5. Rendering of the existing rejected-withdrawal notice through the shared wallet notification component.
6. Browser evidence for the payment-request empty amount validation.

### Deliberately left out

1. No application runtime code changed while creating this record.
2. No new frontend script was added because the existing `start` script is correct.
3. No visual redesign was introduced before the remaining critical screens are reviewed.
4. No backend status, transfer authorization, countdown, or form guard behavior was changed.
5. Active profile dropdown accessibility was tightened without changing logout behavior.
6. No payment request was submitted during this review.

## Next Check-In Format

For each subsequent motion, append:

1. Timestamp with timezone.
2. Surface and action.
3. Result and degree.
4. Evidence path or command.
5. Scope decision.
6. Next exit check.
